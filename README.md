## Ingesting Network Security Telemetry into Splunk using Cisco Telemetry Broker [DEVWKS-2478]

The Cisco Telemetry Broker optimizes your telemetry pipelines for the hybrid cloud. It vastly simplifies the consumption of telemetry data for our customers' business critical tools by brokering hybrid cloud data, filtering unneeded data, and transforming data to a usable format for optimal consumption by analytical tools like Splunk.

In this Lab, the participant will learn how to use the Cisco Telemetry Broker to generate network security telemetry from raw traffic and feed it into the Splunk dashboard for network security visualization - Cisco and Splunk - better together!
